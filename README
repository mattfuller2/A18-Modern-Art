# Project 0: Modern Art

* Author: Matt Fuller
* Class: CS121 Section 6
* Semester: Spring 2017

## Overview

This simple Java program will print characters that mimics a specific style of modern art

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:

$ javac ModernArt.java


Run the compiled class with the command:

$ java ModernArt

## Discussion

After a few days in class learning and practicing the language, I feel like I
did well on this project. The parts that took the most time for me to complete 
were the README and Javadocs documentation.
  
I started my program by creating a ModernArt.java class. Next, I began to 
start typing my code. Within the main method, I used multiple println statements
to print out several asteriks that mimicked a specific type of modern art. I 
then compiled the program into a form the computer can execute using the console.
Finally, I ran the program to check if there were any errors.
  
I had to research the art of Piet Mondrian to get an idea of what 
this specific style of modern art looks like. I learned how to use several 
println statements and characters to mimic this style of painting.

This project started off challenging, since I am new to Java and it's language.
After attending class and completing the first lab, I am more familiar with 
the language and the project became easier.  
 
In the process of working on this project, the console controls and the 
location of where I am in the directories finally "clicked" for me. I also have
a better understanding of how a program is developed.  

Everything that I learned in this project, which includes practically everything
about programming, I will apply to future projects. All programs will have 
similar structures, so developing programs in the future should be easier.
